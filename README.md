[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/standard.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/standard)

This gem is a spiritual port of [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com) and aims
to save you (and others!) time in the same three ways:

* **No configuration.** The easiest way to enforce consistent style in your
  project. Just drop it in.
* **Automatically format code.** Just run `standardrb --fix` and say goodbye to
  messy or inconsistent code.
* **Catch style issues & programmer errors early.** Save precious code review
  time by eliminating back-and-forth between reviewer & contributor.

No decisions to make. It just works. Here's a [⚡ lightning talk
⚡](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLyV5hOqGQ8) about it.

Install Standard and add it to your Gemfile by running:

```sh
bundle add standard --group "development,test"
```

You can then run Standard from the command line with:

```ruby
$ bundle exec standardrb
```

And if you'd like, Standard can autocorrect your code by tacking on a `--fix`
flag.

If your project uses Rake, adding `require "standard/rake"` adds two tasks:
`standard` and `standard:fix`. In most new projects, we tend to add the fixer
variant to our default `rake` task after our test command, similar to this:

```ruby
task default: [:test, "standard:fix"]
```

## StandardRB — The Rules

- **2 spaces** – for indentation
- **Double quotes for string literals** - because pre-committing to whether
  you'll need interpolation in a string slows people down
- **1.9 hash syntax** - When all the keys in a hash literal are symbols,
  Standard enforces Ruby 1.9's `{hash: syntax}`
- **Braces for single-line blocks** - Require `{`/`}` for one-line blocks, but
  allow either braces or `do`/`end` for multiline blocks. Like using `do`/`end`
  for multiline blocks? Prefer `{`/`}` when chaining? A fan of expressing intent
  with Jim Weirich's [semantic
  block](http://www.virtuouscode.com/2011/07/26/the-procedurefunction-block-convention-in-ruby/)
  approach? Standard lets you do you!
- **Leading dots on multi-line method chains** - chosen for
  [these](https://github.com/testdouble/standard/issues/75) reasons.
- **Spaces inside blocks, but not hash literals** - In Ruby, the `{` and `}`
  characters do a lot of heavy lifting. To visually distinguish hash literals
  from blocks, Standard enforces that (like arrays), no leading or trailing
  spaces be added to pad hashes
- **And a good deal more**

If you're familiar with [RuboCop](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop), you
can look at Standard's current base configuration in
[config/base.yml](/config/base.yml). In lieu of a separate changelog file,
significant changes to the configuration will be documented as [GitHub release
notes](https://github.com/testdouble/standard/releases).

## Usage

Once you've installed Standard, you should be able to use the `standardrb`
program. The simplest use case would be checking the style of all Ruby
files in the current working directory:

```bash
$ bundle exec standardrb
standard: Use Ruby Standard Style (https://github.com/testdouble/standard)
standard: Run `standardrb --fix` to automatically fix some problems.
  /Users/code/cli.rb:31:23: Style/Semicolon: Do not use semicolons to terminate expressions.
```

You can optionally pass in a directory (or directories) using a glob pattern.
Be sure to quote paths containing glob patterns so that they are expanded by
`standardrb` instead of your shell:

```bash
$ bundle exec standardrb "lib/**/*.rb" test
```

**Note:** by default, StandardRB will look for all `*.rb` files (and some other
files typically associated with Ruby like `*.gemspec` and `Gemfile`)

If you want to add Standard to an existing project, but don't want to stop all
development until you've fixed every violation in every file, you can create a
backlog of to-be-converted files by generating a TODO file:

```bash
$ bundle exec standardrb --generate-todo
```

This will create a `.standard_todo.yml` that lists all the files that contain
errors. When you run Standard in the future, it will ignore these files as if
they were listed under the `ignore` section in the `.standard.yml` file.

As you refactor your existing project you can remove files from the list. You
can also regenerate the TODO file at any time by re-running the above command.

### Using with Rake

Standard also ships with Rake tasks. If you're using Rails, these should
autoload and be available after installing Standard. Otherwise, just require the
tasks in your `Rakefile`:

```ruby
require "standard/rake"
```

Here are the tasks bundled with Standard:

```
$ rake standard     # equivalent to running `standardrb`
$ rake standard:fix # equivalent to running `standardrb --fix`
```

You may also pass command line options to Standard's Rake tasks by embedding
them in a `STANDARDOPTS` environment variable (similar to how the Minitest Rake
task accepts CLI options in `TESTOPTS`).

```
# equivalent to `standardrb --format progress`:
$ rake standard STANDARDOPTS="--format progress"

# equivalent to `standardrb lib "app/**/*"`, to lint just certain paths:
$ rake standard STANDARDOPTS="lib \"app/**/*\""
```

## What you might do if you're clever

If you want or need to configure Standard, there are a _handful_ of options
available by creating a `.standard.yml` file in the root of your project.

Here's an example yaml file with every option set:

```yaml
fix: true               # default: false
parallel: true          # default: false
format: progress        # default: Standard::Formatter
ruby_version: 2.3.3     # default: RUBY_VERSION
default_ignores: false  # default: true

ignore:                 # default: []
  - 'db/schema.rb'
  - 'vendor/**/*'
  - 'test/**/*':
    - Layout/AlignHash
```

Note: If you're running Standard in a context where your `.standard.yml` file
cannot be found by ascending the current working directory (i.e., against a
temporary file buffer in your editor), you can specify the config location with
`--config path/to/.standard.yml`. (Similarly, for the `.standard_todo.yml` file,
you can specify `--todo path/to/.standard_todo.yml`.)

## What you might do if you're REALLY clever

Because StandardRB is essentially a wrapper on top of
[RuboCop](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop), it will actually forward the
vast majority of CLI and ENV arguments to RuboCop.

You can see a list of
[RuboCop](https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/usage/basic_usage.html#command-line-flags)'s
CLI flags here.

## Why should I use Ruby Standard Style?

(This section will [look
familiar](https://github.com/standard/standard#why-should-i-use-javascript-standard-style)
if you've used StandardJS.)

The beauty of Ruby Standard Style is that it's simple. No one wants to
maintain multiple hundred-line style configuration files for every module/project
they work on. Enough of this madness!

This gem saves you (and others!) time in three ways:

- **No configuration.** The easiest way to enforce consistent style in your
  project. Just drop it in.
- **Automatically format code.** Just run `standardrb --fix` and say goodbye to
  messy or inconsistent code.
- **Catch style issues & programmer errors early.** Save precious code review
  time by eliminating back-and-forth between reviewer & contributor.

Adopting Standard style means ranking the importance of code clarity and
community conventions higher than personal style. This might not make sense for
100% of projects and development cultures, however open source can be a hostile
place for newbies. Setting up clear, automated contributor expectations makes a
project healthier.

## Usage via RuboCop

If you only want to use Standard's rules while continuing to use RuboCop's CLI
(for example, to continue using your favorite IDE/tooling/workflow with RuboCop
support), you can configure this in your `.rubocop.yml`:

```yaml
require: standard

inherit_gem:
  standard: config/base.yml
```

request](https://github.com/testdouble/standard/edit/main/README.md) to let us
know!

## Is there a readme badge?

Yes! If you use Standard in your project, you can include one of these
badges in your readme to let people know that your code is using the StandardRB
style.

```

## I disagree with rule X, can you change it?

No. The whole point of Standard is to save you time by avoiding
[bikeshedding](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/faq/misc.html#bikeshed-painting)
about code style. There are lots of debates online about tabs vs. spaces, etc.
that will never be resolved. These debates just distract from getting stuff
done. At the end of the day you have to 'just pick something', and that's the
whole philosophy of Standard -- it's a bunch of sensible 'just pick something'
opinions. Hopefully, users see the value in that over defending their own
opinions.

Pro tip: Just use Standard and move on. There are actual real problems that
you could spend your time solving! :P

## Is there an automatic formatter?

Yes! You can use `standardrb --fix` to fix most issues automatically.

`standardrb --fix` is built into `standardrb` for maximum convenience. Most
problems are fixable, but some errors must be fixed manually.

## Can I override the `fix: true` config setting?

Also yes! You can use `standardrb --no-fix`. Not `fix`ing is the default
behavior, but this flag will override the `fix: true` setting in your
[`.standard.yml` config](#what-you-might-do-if-youre-clever).
This is especially useful for checking your project's compliance with
`standardrb` in CI environments while keeping the `fix: true` option enabled
locally.

## How do I ignore files?

Sometimes you need to ignore additional folders or specific minified files. To
do that, add a `.standard.yml` file to the root of your project and specify a
list of files and globs that should be excluded:

```yaml
ignore:
  - 'some/file/in/particular.rb'
  - 'a/whole/directory/**/*'
```

You can see the files Standard ignores by default
[here](https://github.com/testdouble/standard/blob/main/lib/standard/creates_config_store/configures_ignored_paths.rb#L3-L13)

## How do I hide a certain warning?

In rare cases, you'll need to break a rule and hide the warning generated by
Standard.

Ruby Standard Style uses [RuboCop](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop)
under-the-hood and you can hide warnings as you normally would if you used
RuboCop directly.

To ignore only certain rules from certain globs (not recommended, but maybe your
test suite uses a non-standardable DSL, you can specify an array of RuboCop
rules to ignore for a particular glob:

```yaml
ignore:
  - 'test/**/*':
    - Layout/EndAlignment
```

## How do I disable a warning within my source code?

You can also use special comments to disable all or certain rules within your
source code.

Given this source listing `foo.rb`:

```ruby
baz = 42
```

Running `standard foo.rb` would fail:

```
foo.rb:1:1: Lint/UselessAssignment: Useless assignment to variable - `baz`.
```

If we wanted to make an exception, we could add the following comment:

```ruby
baz = 42 # standard:disable Lint/UselessAssignment
```

The comment directives (both `standard:disable` and `rubocop:disable`) will
suppress the error and Standard would succeed.

If, however, you needed to disable standard for multiple lines, you could use
open and closing directives like this:

```ruby
# standard:disable Layout/IndentationWidth
def foo
    123
end
# standard:enable Layout/IndentationWidth
```

And if you don't know or care which rule is being violated, you can also
substitute its name for "all". This line actually triggers three different
violations, so we can suppress them like this:

```ruby
baz = ['a'].each do end # standard:disable all
```

## How do I specify a Ruby version? What is supported?

Because Standard wraps RuboCop, they share the same [runtime
requirements](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop#compatibility)—currently,
that's MRI 2.3 and newer. While Standard can't avoid this runtime requirement,
it does allow you to lint codebases that target Ruby versions older than 2.3 by
narrowing the ruleset somewhat.

Standard will default to telling RuboCop to target the currently running version
of Ruby (by inspecting `RUBY_VERSION` at runtime. But if you want to lock it
down, you can specify `ruby_version` in `.standard.yml`.

```
ruby_version: 1.8.7
```

See
[testdouble/suture](https://github.com/testdouble/suture/blob/main/.standard.yml)
for an example.

It's a little confusing to consider, but the targeted Ruby version for linting
may or may not match the version of the runtime (suppose you're on Ruby 2.5.1,
but your library supports Ruby 2.3.0). In this case, specify `ruby_version` and
you should be okay. However, note that if you target a _newer_ Ruby version than
the runtime, RuboCop may behave in surprising or inconsistent ways.

If you are targeting a Ruby older than 2.3 and run into an issue, check out
Standard's [version-specific RuboCop
configurations](https://github.com/testdouble/standard/tree/main/config) and
consider helping out by submitting a pull request if you find a rule that won't
work for older Rubies.

## How do I change the output?

Standard's built-in formatter is intentionally minimal, printing only unfixed
failures or (when successful) printing nothing at all. If you'd like to use a
different formatter, you can specify any of RuboCop's built-in formatters or
write your own.

For example, if you'd like to see colorful progress dots, you can either run
Standard with:

```
$ bundle exec standardrb --format progress
Inspecting 15 files
...............

15 files inspected, no offenses detected
```

Or, in your project's `.standard.yml` file, specify:

```yaml
format: progress
```

Refer to RuboCop's [documentation on
formatters](https://rubocop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formatters/) for more
information.

## How do I run Standard in my editor?

It can be very handy to know about failures while editing to shorten the
feedback loop. Some editors support asynchronously running linters.

## Why aren't `frozen_string_literal: true` magic comments enforced?

Standard does not take a stance on whether you should plaster a
[frozen_string_literal magic
comment](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.0/doc/syntax/comments_rdoc.html#label-Magic+Comments)
directive at the top of every file. Enforcing use of the comment became popular
when it was believed that string literals would be frozen by default in a future
version of Ruby, but [according to
Matz](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11473#note-53) there are no (longer any)
such plans.

Aside from one's personal opinion on the degree to which the comment is an
eyesore, the decision to include the magic comment at the top of every file
listing ought to be made based on the performance characteristics of each
project (e.g. whether it defines a significant number of string literals,
whether the commensurate memory usage is a material constraint, whether the code
is run as a one-off command or a long-lived server application). These tend to
indicate whether the magic comment might lead to meaningful reductions in memory
usage.

Because Standard is intended to be used as a default for every kind of Ruby
file—from shell scripts to Rails apps—it wouldn't be appropriate for Standard to
either enforce or preclude the magic comment. Instead, you might consider
either:

* Measuring memory performance by enabling frozen string literals as
  the default at runtime (with `RUBYOPT=--enable-frozen-string-literal`)
* Introducing the
  [magic_frozen_string_literal](https://github.com/Invoca/magic_frozen_string_literal)
  gem to your build, which will automatically ensure that the comment is
  prepended for every applicable file in your project

## How do I use Standard with RuboCop extensions?

This is not officially supported by Standard. However, Evil Martians wrote up [a
regularly updated
guide](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/rubocoping-with-legacy-bring-your-ruby-code-up-to-standard)
on how to do so.

## Does Standard work with [Insert other tool name here]?

Maybe! Start by searching the repository to see if there's an existing issue
open for the tool you're interested in. That aside, here are other known
integrations aside from editor plugins:
